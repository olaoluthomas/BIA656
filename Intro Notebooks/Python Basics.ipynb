In these notes, we'll present three basic data structures, the list, the set, and the dictionary. Python data structures are very rich, and beyond the scope of this simple primer.

Lists allow duplicate values, but indices are unique. In python, like most programming languages, list indices start at 0, that is, to get the first element in a list, request the element at index 0. Lists provide very fast access to elements at specific positions, but are inefficient at \"membership queries,\" determining if an element is in the array. \n",

    "When reading, you typically want to iterate through the lines in a file using a for loop, as above. Some other common methods for dealing with files are: \n",

    "+ `file.read()`: read the entire contents of a file into a string\n",
    "+ `file.readline()`: read one line of a file\n",
    "+ `file.write(some_string)`: writes to the file, note this doesn't automatically include any new lines. Also note that sometimes writes are buffered- python will wait until you have several writes pending, and perform them all at once\n",
    "+ `file.flush()`: write out any buffered writes\n",
    "+ `file.close()`: close the open file. This will free up some computer resources occupied by keeping a file open.\n",
    "+ `file.seek(position)`: moves to a specific position within a file. Note that position is specified in bytes. \n",
